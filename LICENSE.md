# Jahro Unity Plugin License (v1.0)

Version Date: August 17, 2025

Applies to: https://github.com/jahro-console/unity-package

Jahro Unity Plugin (“**Plugin**”) is provided by Oleksii Bulat, conducting business as a sole proprietorship registered in Poland (NIP: 6762646844, REGON: 525829500) (“**Licensor**”).

“**Licensee**” means any person or entity that downloads, installs, or uses the Plugin.

“**Web App**” refers to Jahro’s proprietary web-based application available at https://console.jahro.io, which provides cloud synchronization, log storage, team collaboration tools, and other related functionality.

By downloading, installing, or using the Plugin, the Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Jahro Unity Plugin License (“License”).

## License Grant

The Licensor grants the Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use the Plugin solely for integration into projects developed with the Unity game engine (Unity 2021.3.0f1 or later), for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, and only for the purpose of capturing logs, screenshots, variables, and commands and synchronizing them with the Web App, in accordance with the restrictions set forth herein.

No attribution is required when using the Plugin. However, crediting Jahro in your project or documentation is welcome but entirely optional.

Commercial use of the Plugin is permitted when integrated into the Licensee’s own projects, provided that the Plugin is not resold, sublicensed, or offered as a stand-alone product or competing tool.

The Plugin can operate without the Web App in a limited offline mode. Cloud synchronization, team collaboration, and historical log storage are only available when connected to the Web App via a valid API key.

## Prohibited Use

The Licensee may not:

Redistribute, resell, sublicense, or otherwise make the Plugin available to any third party.
Modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works from the Plugin, except for minimal adjustments strictly required for compatibility or debugging that do not interfere with API key verification or communication with Jahro servers.
Use the Plugin, whether modified or unmodified, as part of a competing product or developer tool (including but not limited to listing it on Unity Asset Store).
Bypass or attempt to bypass API key verification or API calls.
Rely on the public availability of the source code in the GitHub repository as granting any rights beyond those expressly permitted in this License.

Notwithstanding the above, Licensee may fork the Plugin's source code for internal use within their own projects, provided that such modifications are not redistributed, sold, or used to circumvent API key verification or to develop competing tools.

## API Key Requirements

An API key is required to enable synchronization with the Web App.

The API key is issued per project and is linked to the Licensee’s Web App account. It may be used on an unlimited number of devices within that specific project.

After initial verification, the Plugin may store data locally and operate in offline mode. Continued synchronization with the Web App requires periodic API key verification.

If the API key is missing, invalid, revoked, or cannot be verified ((e.g., due to account deletion, suspension, or subscription expiry):
the Plugin may still launch and operate locally with limited functionality;
cloud synchronization, team sharing, and other connected features will be unavailable;
an error message will be displayed indicating the missing or invalid API key.

The Licensee must not use any API key issued to another account or project without authorisation. The Licensor may suspend or disable access to the Plugin if unauthorized API key usage is detected.

## Ownership and Intellectual Property

The Plugin and all associated intellectual property rights remain the sole property of the Licensor.

The Plugin does not incorporate any third-party libraries or code that are made available to the Licensee.

Although the Plugin’s source code is publicly available, it is not released under an open-source license. Access to the source code does not imply permission to modify, redistribute, or use it beyond the rights expressly granted in this License.

Contributions made to the Plugin via GitHub or other channels automatically become the property of the Licensor.

The Licensee must not remove, alter, or obscure any copyright notices or proprietary markings contained in the Plugin.

## Territorial Restrictions

The Plugin may not be downloaded, installed, accessed, or otherwise used in any jurisdiction that is subject to trade, economic, or other sanctions or restrictive measures under the laws of Poland and the European Union, or any other applicable jurisdiction. This includes, without limitation, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus, and any other territory or country listed on official sanctions lists maintained by the Government of Poland, the European Union, and other competent authorities.

The Licensor reserves the right to:
apply geo-blocking or other technical measures to prevent access from such jurisdictions;
suspend or terminate any API key or account found to be in use in violation of this section;
deny technical support, updates, or other services to users located in or accessing the Plugin from sanctioned jurisdictions.

The Licensee is solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable export control laws, sanctions, and restrictions in their jurisdiction before using the Plugin.

## Updates and Compatibility

The Licensor may, at its sole discretion, release updates to the Plugin, which may be categorized as:
сritical updates – addressing security vulnerabilities, data loss risks, or major bugs;
major updates – introducing new features or significant changes to functionality;
minor updates – providing performance improvements, bug fixes, or small enhancements.

The Licensor may also deprecate older versions of the Plugin. Deprecation may result in reduced functionality, limited compatibility with the Web App, or complete cessation of operation, especially if older versions are no longer compatible with the Licensor’s systems or third-party dependencies. The Licensor further reserves the right to fully disable unsupported versions, including by preventing their connection to the Web App.

The Licensor will provide reasonable notice of updates or deprecations, blocks etc. via official communication channels, including but not limited to:
announcements on the official Jahro Discord server;
email notifications to registered users;
in-Plugin notifications where technically feasible.

The Licensee is responsible for ensuring that they use a supported version of the Plugin. Continued use of deprecated versions is at the Licensee’s own risk.

Certain updates, including but not limited to security patches and critical compatibility fixes, may be mandatory. Continues use of the Plugin without applying such updates may result in reduced functionality or termination of access to the Web App features.

## Warranties

The Plugin is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”, without any warranties, conditions, or guarantees of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Licensor specifically disclaims:
any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement;
any warranties that the Plugin will meet the Licensee’s requirements, operate without interruption, or be error-free;
any warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or timeliness of data synchronization between the Plugin and the Web App.

The Licensee assumes all risks associated with the installation, operation, and use of the Plugin.

The Licensee is solely responsible for backing up any data, logs, or other content generated or stored through the use of the Plugin.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Licensor shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, including but not limited to:
loss of data, logs, or screenshots;
corruption of Unity projects;
downtime of the Web App;
failures caused by third-party services, dependencies, or integrations;
loss of business opportunities, revenue, or profits.

In all cases, the Licensor’s total aggregate liability under this License, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the amount paid (if any) by the Licensee for the Plugin.

## Termination

This License is effective from the moment the Licensee downloads, installs, or uses the Plugin and shall remain in effect for as long as the Licensee uses the Plugin in compliance with its terms.

The Licensor may terminate this License immediately and without prior notice if the Licensee breaches any provision of this License.

Upon termination:
all rights granted to the Licensee under this License shall cease immediately;
the Licensee must stop using the Plugin and delete all copies in their possession or control, including any backup or archived copies;
the Licensor may disable the Licensee’s API key and restrict access to any associated Web App features.

Termination does not limit the Licensor’s right to seek other remedies available under applicable law.

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This License shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Poland, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this License, its breach, termination, or validity, shall be resolved exclusively by the competent courts of Poland.
